The fish classification using object detection project aims to accurately detect and classify different types of fish in images and videos. To achieve this, the project uses the popular You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm, which is known for its fast and accurate object detection capabilities. Additionally, the project utilizes the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, which contains a wide variety of objects, including fish.

To train and validate the accuracy of the model, the project makes use of the COCO dataset, which contains over 330,000 images of 80 different object categories, including fish. The dataset has been annotated with bounding boxes and labels for each object, which allows the YOLO algorithm to detect and classify fish accurately.

The project involves several steps, including preprocessing the dataset, training the YOLO model on the dataset, and evaluating the accuracy of the model on a validation set. The project also includes tuning the hyperparameters of the YOLO model to achieve better accuracy.

Once the YOLO model is trained and validated, it can be used to detect and classify fish in real-world images and videos. The model can be integrated with other applications or used as a standalone tool to identify fish species, count fish populations, and monitor aquatic environments.

Overall, the fish classification using object detection project demonstrates the power of YOLO object detection and the COCO dataset in accurately detecting and classifying fish in images and videos. The project has significant applications in the fields of aquatic ecology, fisheries management, and marine conservation.
